## todo:
re-implement the title infer system for low count searches using smith waterman + sorensen dice coef

make infered information (episode released so far based on start release date / weeks since then) special colors for the user to distinguish between factual informations
use the sneedex api to get best quality sources https://sneedex.moe/api/public/nyaa
make use of Taiga's https://github.com/erengy/anime-relations list to try and infer as accurate episode number as possible.
